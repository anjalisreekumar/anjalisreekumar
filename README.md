# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a mobile developer who mostly writes code in Swift. I have over 2 years of experience working on native iOS apps. I enjoy this domain because Swift was the first language that made me think, "hell yeah, even I can write cool programs." You could say it's my ride or die programming language ðŸ˜Ž. Please feel free to look around!

### Currently Working On ðŸš§

- [StreamCircle](https://github.com/anjalisreekumar/StreamCircle) â€” Building a live streaming app from scratch using only free tools! Firebase handles auth, the Agora free tier powers all the streaming magic, and Mixpanel is there for analytics (probably overkill, but hey, learning new stuff is always fun!). Focusing on unit tests and trying out test-driven development with MVVM. Oh, and I also got to play around with Appleâ€™s Icon Composer for this project.
